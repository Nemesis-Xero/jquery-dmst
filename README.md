Dynamic Multi-Select Tool - A jQuery plugin
===========================================

The goal of this jQuery plugin is to create a simple tool which provides a robust, generic solution for a problem generally handled by a static, hard-coded approach. The problem is this: How can one deal with the volativity of the typical multi-select box gracefully?

This problem arises when, within an html form, the user must be able to choose one or more pre-determined options for a single input field and those choices must be preserved upon reloading the form. For example, a form defining a data entity which can later be editted. When using a typical multi-select box, a single unintentional left-click can obliterate all the previously selected choices.
